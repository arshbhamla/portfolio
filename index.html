            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello, my name is Arsh, I'm an electrical engineering student studying at the New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT) with a track of RF engineering.</p>
            <p>Why RF? My first taste of it was when taking my electromagnetics class. The class was hard, but it also got me interested with the field.</p>
            <p>This last summer, I was motivated to get my ham radio license, and am currently building an AM radio transceiver. I want to keep going, with work experience and more classes to develop myself for a professional career.</p>

            <h3>What Else?</h3>
            <p><b>Physics Tutoring: </b>My current job at NJIT is in the Department of Physics as a tutor. For a few hours a week, I work in the Physics Tutoring center to help students through six classes of information, ranging from everything like Newton's laws all the way to quantum mechanics. While I don't want to be a teacher, I like that it's made me better at both articulating what I want to say better, and honestly do better at retaining information myself</p>
            <p><b>Solar Development Workshop: </b>Located out of Passaic County Community College (PCCC), this summer I've been working as part of <a href="https://people.njit.edu/profile/ravindra">Dr. Ravi's</a> group helping students learn about photovoltaics and solar panels. I've been able to learn a bunch myself about the chemistry behind these cells, and Dr. Ravi shares insights into his research on solar cells through his papers</p>
            <p><b>IEEE: </b>One of my favorite commitments is as part of NJIT's IEEE Student Branch. We serve the ECE body here at NJIT with kits and maintain one of the largest rooms spaces of any club on campus. From now until next year, I'm the secretary for the branch, and previously was the project room manager. I find it pretty rewarding to manage the internal committee now, which is a team of me and six other students making sure IEEE's space is kept in good condition, and maintaining our social media presence</p>
            <p><b>Eta Kappa Nu (HKN): </b>HKN's an honor society that I was inducted into earlier this year (2025). I plan to be the tutor for the electromagnetics class (ECE361) the next semester to help many of my fellow students prepare for the class and its exams</p>
            <p><b>Antenna and Propagation Society (APS): </b>APS is a new club coming to NJIT. We are currently in the process of creating the club, going through both the procedures in the national society and also through NJIT's student senate in order to make it</p>

            <h2>Skills</h2>
            <h3>Technical Skills</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Spice Simulation: I use NI Multisim and recently started using ltSpice for spice simulations</li>
                <li>Computer Aided Design (CAD): I've mainly used Autodesk Inventor, although I've worked a little with AutoCAD as well</li>
                <li>PCB Design: My newest tool, I'm currently learning how to use Altium Designer for schematics and pcb designing</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Programming</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Python: It's been a while since I've used python, but I will be taking a class in machine learning using python</li>
                <li>C++: Primarily in the context of microcontrollers like Arduino and ESP32</li>
                <li>MATLAB: Used for my classes and I've started using it for its RF toolboxes</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Electronic Equipment</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Vector Network Analyzer (VNA): I bought a NanoVNA off of amazon and plan to use that for testing the VSWR for the transceiver. I'll also be using a VNA on a bench next semester in my RF class</li>
                <li>Spectrum Analyzer: I haven't used it much yet, but I will need it in developing the physical antenna and making adjustments to length</li>
                <li>Oscilliscope: I'm very comfortable using an oscilliscope, having used it in our Analog and Digital Lab (ECE294) and as a lab bench manager for IEEE</li>
                <li>Soldering Iron: I've done some soldering as practice and with helping younger students in using the irons safely on solder boards. I will be using it more once I make the PCB</li>
                <li>Signal Generator: The signal generators at NJIT go up to 15MHz and are capable of providing several different types of waves. I've used them in various projects and labs for classes</li>
                <li>RF Power Meter: I haven't used this yet, but I am intending to get one in a few months for setting up my own ham radio shack at home</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>Other Skills</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>Ham Radio Operation (General License): My callsign is KE2GIG, I've been meaning to start next semester or when I can complete my own radio</li>
                <li>Team Collaboration: Being able to work well with others is one of the cornerstones of engineering. I work well with groups, being able to communicate my opinions and actively listen to others when they bring ideas. It also means being able to challenge one another and accept criticism. While I am by no means an extrovert, I appreicate having others to work with to complete a project</li>
                <li>Learning: Life is all about learning. Being in university means that I have this oppertunity to learn not only from my professors, but from guest speakers, researchers, and my fellow students. I love challenging myself and taking on problems if it means learning something new, or teaching others something I know</li>
                <li>Problem Solving: I can never say that the projects, classes, and work that I do come without challenges, but being able to figure out solutions to those problems is what sets me apart. I've consistently been able to put large amounts of effort behind any problem and while it is difficult at the time, I'm always willing to keep trying until I figure something out. This also means using my resources, asking for help, and being humble when I'm wrong</li>
            </ul>

            <h2>Projects</h2>
            <h3>AM Radio Transceiver</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>I started this project back in July; the goal is to make a fully working AM transceiver entirely from scratch</li>
                <li>It's pretty ambitious, but I've been chipping away at it slowly and it's been making me learn about all the softwares used in industry</li>
                <img src="images/schematicFirstDraft.png" alt="Schematic First Draft" class="project-image">
                <p>This is the first draft I made using NI Multisim. The problem with this software is that it isn't able to compute higher than several megahertz frequencies. I'm currently redoing the numbers and running it in ltSpice</p>
                <img src="images/transceiverFirstResults.png" alt="First Draft Results" class="project-image">
                <p>This is the results I got from this circuit. It matches the results I wanted, but I will be redoing this in ltSpice to get the results on the frequency I need</p>
                <img src="images/schematicSecondDraft.png" alt="Schematic Second Draft on ltSpice" class="project-image">
                <p>This is the first iteration I've done on ltSpice. It isn't working, but I'm currently working on making sure that it works using the original component values that I already solved for, then retesting with more accurate numbers for the 435MHz signal I want to use</p>
                <img src="images/yagiUdaMatlab.png" alt="Yagi Uda on Matlab" class="project-image">
                <p>I posted a photo to show the work that can be done on MATLAB. Of course, not all the tiles I'm showing were needed, I just wanted to show what it's capable of apart from being able to help me with the sizes</p>
                <li>The next steps are in finishing the ltSpice simulation and also working on the pcb in Altium Designer</li>
            </ul>
            <h3>RC Car</h3>
            <ul>
                <li>This is one of my older projects, but I love the RC car a lot because of how much it forced me to learn about team work, working under time constraints, problem solving, and more technical skills relating to microcontrollers.</li>
                <li>The idea was a simple one, we wanted to make a car that could be controlled remotely. But problems arose in two main areas: the power requirements for all of the different components was wholeheartedly complicated, and the ESP32 wifi protocols (which was what we originally intended to use) didn't work with NJIT's firewall.</li>
                <img src="images/rcCar.png" alt="RC Car" class="project-image">
                <p>The result was a car that was neither efficient nor reliable. It was a lot about compromise, having to reduce the weight of the car even if it looked aesthetically displeasing, learning how to use relays in order to get the voltage up to par, and using up what is considered an exceptional amount of batteries.</p>
                <li>My contributions were in writing the code in the ESP32s, developing the website, and in wiring up all the circuitry. Unfortunately, I didn't think of saving my code from my projects, so there's only the finished product to show for it.</li>
