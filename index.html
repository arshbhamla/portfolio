            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>Hello, my name is Arsh, I'm an electrical engineering student studying at the New Jersey Institute of Technology (NJIT) with a track of RF design.</p>
            <p>Why RF? My first taste of it was when taking my electromagnetics class. It was hard, but it also got me interested with the field.</p>
            <p>This last summer, I was motivated to get my ham radio license, and am currently building an AM radio transceiver. I want to keep going, with work experience and more classes to develop myself for a professional career.</p>
